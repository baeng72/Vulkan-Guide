<b>Vulkan Guide</b><br/>
GLFW version of Vulkan Guide available at <a href="https://vkguide.dev/">https://vkguide.dev/</a> by Victor Blanco



To get this to build you'll need Visual Studio (I'm using 2019), Vulkan SDK, GLFW, GLM.
The project paths are very idiosynchratic, that'll need to be updated in configuration to local paths.
